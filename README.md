# DevCon

A simple DevCon app to display the schedule of events with details.

I deployed the app on Netlify, https://devcon-demo.netlify.app/

I used some UX inspiration from https://pretalx.com/democon/schedule/

### Functionalities

- Show events based on date and rooms.
- Event page for every individual event.
- List of speakers in the DevCon.


### Improvements that can be made

- Display the events in a calendar type of view.
- UI can be made responsive.
- Individual speaker pages.
- Save events based to Google Calendar.


## Running the app locally

Clone the repo and cd into the folder.

#### Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### Start the app in development mode
```bash
npm run start
```
